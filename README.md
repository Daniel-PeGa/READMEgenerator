# READMEgenerator

## Project Description

This is a simple project that makes use of inquirer to prompt the user through the command line specific questions regarding the structure of a proffessional-looking README.md file. Funny enough, I havent used it for this, but it does work.

## Future development

I'd like to fix the probleem it's been having with the badges not working and maybe adding some more work to make it seem cooler and all

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
